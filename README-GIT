GIT commands
============

0. Add SSH key
==============
https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PCDS/GitHub+tips

cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa 
... then enter the name, i.e.: id_github_rsa
ls -al
cat id_github_rsa.pub

eval `ssh-agent -s` # - starts ssh agent for bash
eval `ssh-agent -c` # for tcsh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_github_rsa

Then in https://github.com/msdubrovin/scikit-beam
-> Settings -> Deploy keys -> add the key


1. Create empty central shared repository for project pyapps:
=============================================================
on afs:
mkdir ~/git-repo
cd git-repo

git init --bare pyapps.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /reg/neh/home1/dubrovin/LCLS/git-repo/pyapps.git/


2. clone (any) repo to local work repository
============================================
create working copy of local repository (for example on afs):
mkdir git-work
cd git-work
git clone path-to/git-repo/pyapps.git

Example using ssh on nfs:
mkdir ~/LCLS/git-work
cd ~/LCLS/git-work
git clone ssh://dubrovin@pcds113.slac.stanford.edu/afs/slac.stanford.edu/u/br/dubrovin/git-repo/pyapps.git

Also note that the *.git extension is omitted from the cloned repository. This reflects the non-bare status of the local copy.
cd pyapps
... work on project

2a. Example using ssh from github:
==================================
Assumes 3 repos: 
  - upstream: scikit-beam/scikit-beam
  - origin:   msdubrovin/scikit-beam
  - local:    master

mkdir ~/LCLS/github-work
cd ~/LCLS/github-work
git clone git@github.com:msdubrovin/scikit-beam

Other options:
git clone git@github.com:slaclab/lclslib.git
git clone https://github.com/slaclab/lclslib.git


cd scikit-beam
python setup.py install

# for development:
python setup.py develop
pip install nose coverage setuptools

... work on project



2b. Add more repositories (upstream)
============================================
# Add the remote, call it "upstream":
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scikit-beam/scikit-beam

# List of remote repos
git remote -v


3. configure git
================
git config --global user.name Mikhail
git config --global user.email dubrovin@slac.stanford.edu
git config --system core.editor emacs

Or edit file ~/.gitconfig
git config --global --edit


4. add & commit
===============
You can propose changes (add it to the Index) using
git add <filename>
git add <directory>
git add *
git add -p; begins interactive staging session
git status


5. push changes
===============

commit to the HEAD of local repository:
git commit -m "Commit message"

push changes to remote repository:
git push origin master

if local repository was not clonned,
connect local repository to remote server:
git remote get origin <server>

List all currently configured remote repositories:
git remote -v


6. branching
============

List all the branches in your repo, and also tell you what branch you're currently in:	
git branch
git branch -r # for remote
git branch -l # for local
git branch -a # for all

Switch from one branch to another:	
git checkout <branchname>

create a new branch named "feature_x" and switch to it using
git checkout -b feature_x

switch back to master
git checkout master

and delete the branch again
git branch -d feature_x

a branch is not available to others unless you push the branch to your remote repository
git push origin <branch>


7. update & merge
=================
to update your local repository to the newest commit, execute 
git pull

in your working directory to fetch and merge remote changes.
to merge another branch into your active branch (e.g. master), use
git merge <branch>

in both cases git tries to auto-merge changes. 
Unfortunately, this is not always possible and results in conflicts. 
You are responsible to merge those conflicts manually by editing the files shown by git. 
After changing, you need to mark them as merged with
git add <filename>

before merging changes, you can also preview them by using
git diff <source_branch> <target_branch>


8. tagging
==========
it's recommended to create tags for software releases. this is a known concept, which also exists in SVN. 
You can create a new tag named 1.0.0 by executing
git tag 1.0.0 1b2e1d63ff

the 1b2e1d63ff stands for the first 10 characters of the commit id you want to reference with your tag. 
You can get the commit id by looking at the... 


9. log
======
in its simplest form, you can study repository history using.. 
git log

You can add a lot of parameters to make the log look like what you want. To see only the commits of a certain author:
git log --author=bob

To see a very compressed log where each commit is one line:
git log --pretty=oneline

Or maybe you want to see an ASCII art tree of all the branches, decorated with the names of tags and branches: 
git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all

See only which files have changed: 
git log --name-status

These are just a few of the possible parameters you can use. For more, see git log --help
replace local changes

In case you did something wrong, you can replace local changes using the command
git checkout -- <filename>

this replaces the changes in your working tree with the last content in HEAD. 
Changes already added to the index, as well as new files, will be kept.

If you instead want to drop all your local changes and commits, 
fetch the latest history from the server and point your local master branch at it like this
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master


10. update local repo from upstream
===================================
# Add the remote, call it "upstream":
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scikit-beam/scikit-beam

# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,
# such as upstream/master:
git fetch upstream

# Make sure that you're on your master branch:
git checkout master


??? git pull upstream master


# Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that
# aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that
# other branch:
git rebase upstream/master

If you've rebased your branch onto upstream/master you may need to force the push in order to push it to your own forked repository on GitHub. You'd do that with:

git push -f origin master

You only need to use the -f the first time after you've rebased.



Misc commands
=============

git mv old new
